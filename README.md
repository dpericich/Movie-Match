# Movie Match

<hr>
## Description

This app is a movie pairing app that allows 2 users to like movies and see where their choices overlap. The point is to make movie nights or movie selections in general easier.

I am setting up the table relationships to allow a user to share their movie preferences with more than 1 other user. This will allow them to have multiple movie connections who can view shared movie desires / interests.

## Tech Used

Front End:

1. NextJS
2. TypeScript
3. Tailwind CSS
4. Redux (Potentially)

Back End:

1. NodeJS
2. ExpressJS
3. PostgreSQL

DevOps

1. Docker
2. Hosting TBD

## Project Setup

I will add instructions on how to pull and run this project locally later. My current concerns are getting the basic structure of the app setup. Then I want to Dockerize all of the code (only PostgreSQL is currently running in a Docker container). I am planning on using seeds files with Faker to be able to replicate local data. However, I still will need to add bind mountings to allow local development against the app.
